1917 Dataset
============

Reconstructing specifically based on localities in December 1917(``1917-12-31``).

In October 1917(``1917-10-01``), the area of some urban localities were shrinked, to make them cover only urban areas. In addition to that, lots of localities with generic names had been renamed to the names of their main towns or villages, i.e. the seats of localities.
